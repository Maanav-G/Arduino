Arduino Geninuno 101 with a built in Gyroscope, Accelerometer and a IMU device calibrated to tabulate and map the x, y and z values of the Accelerometer as well as the acceleration based on the movement. Through which the specified “head nod” is determined, and once determined, activates a signal/alert (currently in the form of a blink). 

Project Description: 
	Many of us have experienced being on the verge of falling asleep on the wheel, whether that be due to being tired, sleepy, or having case of sleep apnea. To combat this, a headgear is developed that, using a accelerometer, determines that typical “head nod” of someone falling asleep, which then, via bluetooth, enables an alert system on an application on your iOS device, to essentially wake you up.
